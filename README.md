# Avatar-Generator-with-real-Image-using-Deep-Learning

## Problem Statement - Avatar Generation from Real Images using Deep Learning

Creating avatars from real images is a fascinating and challenging problem in computer vision and deep learning. The task at hand is to develop a system capable of generating personalized avatar images from real photographs of individuals. These avatars should capture the essence of the person while stylizing them in a unique and artistic way.

## Implementation

The system will be implemented using the following technologies:

- Python
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow

The system will be trained on a large dataset of real photographs and avatar images. The dataset will be collected from unsplash.

The system will be trained using a generative adversarial network (GAN). The GAN will be implemented using the PyTorch framework.



## Installing the requirements
```shell
!pip install diffusers accelerate safetensors transformers
```

## Usage

To use the system, users will need to provide the system with a real photograph of themselves. The system will then generate an avatar image of the user. Users can customize their avatars to match their personal style by choosing from a variety of different hairstyles, clothing, and accessories.
